# AJ's dotfiles

These dotfiles are a set of configuration files for Mac OS X and Linux, that make my life in front of the keyboard just a little bit easier.

dotfiles are like a developer's toolbox.

I am using Mac OS X 10.9 and my preferred Linux distribution is Debian.  
Currently running Debian 7.4 (wheezy)


For more information on dotfiles, checkout [dotfiles.github.io](http://dotfiles.github.io/)


## Installation

Run the following commands in your terminal. It will prompt you before it does anything destructive. Check out the [Rakefile](https://github.com/AJ-Acevedo/dotfiles/blob/master/Rakefile) to see exactly what it does.

```terminal
git clone git://github.com/aj-acevedo/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
rake install
```

After the installation completes, open a new terminal window to see the changes take effect.


## Features

- Tab auto-completion for Git and Grunt JS
- Custom list of git config aliases and configurations
- Add a Git repo's branch name to the PS1 PROMT with red, yellow and green status indicators:
'user@hostname cwd (git_branch â€¢ )$ '
- Matching TextMate and vim themes
- vim customization

## Uninstall

To remove the dotfile configs, run the following commands.  
Be certain to double check the contents of the files before removing so you don't lose custom settings.

```
unlink ~/.bash_profile  
unlink ~/.bashrc  
unlink ~/.gemrc  
unlink ~/.gitignore  
unlink ~/.irbrc  
unlink ~/.railsrc  
unlink ~/.vim  
unlink ~/.vimrc  
rm ~/.gitconfig  
rm -rf ~/.dotfiles  
```

Then open a new terminal window to see the changes take effect.


Feel free to clone, modify, share, and use these dotfiles as your own.
