# AJ's dotfiles

These dotfiles are a set of configuration files for macOS and Linux, that make my life in front of the keyboard just a little bit easier.
  
dotfiles are like a developer's toolbox.

I am using macOS High Sierra 10.13 and my preferred Linux distribution is Debian.  
Currently running Debian 9 (Stretch)


For more information on dotfiles, checkout [dotfiles.github.io](http://dotfiles.github.io/)


## Installation

Run the following commands in your terminal. It will prompt you before it does anything destructive. Check out the [Rakefile](https://github.com/AJ-Acevedo/dotfiles/blob/master/Rakefile) to see exactly what it does.

```terminal
git clone git://github.com/aj-acevedo/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
rake install
```

After the installation completes, open a new terminal window to see the changes take effect.

NOTE: There are additional installer scripts in the `~/.dotfiles/init` directory that can be run as well. 


## Updating and adding VIM plugins

To update the VIM plug-ins, run the following commands from the .dotfiles root directory

```
mkdir -p ~/.vim/autoload ~/.vim/bundle && \
curl -LSso ~/.vim/autoload/pathogen.vim https://tpo.pe/pathogen.vim
```

`git submodule foreach git pull origin master`

When adding new VIM plug-ins, be sure to add them as git submodules

`git submodule add git@github.com:scrooloose/nerdtree.git`


## Features

- Tab auto-completion for Git and Grunt JS
- Custom list of git config aliases and configurations
- Add a Git repo's branch name to the PS1 prompt with red, yellow and green status indicators:
'user@hostname cwd (git_branch â€¢ )$ '

## Uninstall

To remove the dotfile configs, run the following commands.  
Be certain to double check the contents of the files before removing so you don't lose custom settings.

```
unlink ~/.bash_profile  
unlink ~/.bashrc  
unlink ~/.gemrc  
unlink ~/.gitignore  
unlink ~/.irbrc  
unlink ~/.railsrc  
unlink ~/.vim  
unlink ~/.vimrc  
rm ~/.gitconfig  
rm -rf ~/.dotfiles  
```

Then open a new terminal window to see the changes take effect.
